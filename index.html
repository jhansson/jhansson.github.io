                              Have you ever had this recurring dream, a dream where you revisit a specific moment, 
                              a time when something went wrong? In Echo, you are in exactly that dream.

                          <p>
                            I was mainly responsible for the character movement and interactions. 
                            The movement is a custom made physics based system that allows for more realistic
                            and predictable interactions with the environment than with the default Unreal character.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The goal for interacting with objects was to get a fairly realistic movement where it look 
                            and feel like you as a player are dragging around a physical object.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Physics constraints are used to attach the object to the player and IK is then used on the 
                            hands and arms to position them on the object's surface. Raycasting is used to get locations.
                          </p>

                          Since there only was two main actions (jumping and dragging) I should have prioritized to make sure
                          they felt really good for the player to execute. Jumping should feel more fluid when used from a 
                          running state. Dragging objects around should be stabilized by using two physical constraints, simulating 
                          the attachments of both hands of the player.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I learned that by creating your own movement system you gain a lot of flexibility, but it also takes
                          more time than I expected. There are a lot of small things that makes up a solid movement system, like
                          keeping track of all possible edge cases and states the character can be in.

                              Inspired by games like Shadow of the Colossus and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
                              I've created a Blueprint based climbing system in Unreal Engine 4. Being able to climb freely
                              gives the player a lot of interesting ways to explore the world.
                          </p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <h3 style="text-align: center">What I did</h3>
                        <div class="col-7">                          
                          <p>
                            A system that lets the player climb freely on any surface in the world. The surfaces can 
                            be static or moving. The climbing activated when moving into a climbable object within a certain
                            angle threshold between the climbable normal and the way the player looks. Raycasting is then used to 
                            check if it's possible to climb in the input direction. If possible, a helper will be created at the 
                            local position of the raycast hit in the object being climbed upon. This way when we lerp to this position,
                            it doesn't matter if the object moves, we always have the local position stored.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The system uses IK and physical animations to have better placements on hands and feet.
                            If the character can't reach any surface with its feet, partial ragdoll effect will be used on 
                            spine and down to get more dynamic and fitting animations.
                          </p>                         
                      </div>

                          Creating more advanced features in Blueprint is not easy and clearly not what it is designed for.
                          Many of the complicated blueprints could have been written in a few lines of C#.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I have gained a lot of knowledge of Blueprint and can appreciate the power of visual scripting.

                                      The aim for the movement was to find a good balance between sliding on the ice but still
                                      have responsive controls. Character movement is based on the Unreal character movement with 
                                      modifications to make it feel like you're sliding around on ice.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    For the camera I set up blueprint to make the camera zoom in and out depending on where the 
                                    players are, making sure they are all in frame of the camera. This way the camera gets closer
                                    to the action when all players are close to each other.
                                  </p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="row">
                                <h3 style="text-align: center">What I learned</h3>
                              <div class="col-8 center-col">

                                  In intensive party games, it's better to go for more arcade feeling in the controls. 
                                  The user experience was affected negatively by having the players slide to much on the ice.
                                  By making the controls more responsive the players would have felt more in control of their characters.
                                </p>

                                  I also learned that you can make a pretty good prototype for a game in two weeks with
                                  good communication in the team.
